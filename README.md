# Volttron PNNL AEMS

This repository contains two projects: `aems-edge` and `aems-app`. The `aems-ui` project is deprecated and will be removed in the future.

## Autonomous Energy Management Software (AEMS)
The AEMS adds intelligent and flexible control for small- and medium-sized commercial buildings' HVAC systems.
The AEMS leverages the VOLTTRONâ„¢ platform to deliver effective control and energy management solutions for rooftop units (RTUs) and heat pumps (HPs).
The AEMS contains a web based user interface (aems-app) to allow a building operator or occupants to easily enable energy efficiency and comfort for their building.
The second component is the aems-edge. The edge software is integrated with the VOLTTRON project and utilizes the BACnet driver for device integration, the VOLTTRON Historian for data storage, and the VOLTTRON integrated Weather.gov for forecast information.

## Overview

The AEMS system is designed to bring advanced energy efficiency and grid-responsive control to SMBs. It comprises two main components:

1. **Web-Based User Interface**: An intuitive interface that allows building managers to configure, monitor, and optimize energy usage. The web UI facilitates user interactions and data visualization for easy energy management.
2. **Edge Stack Integrated with VOLTTRON**: This component operates at the building edge, using VOLTTRON for real-time control and integration with HVAC systems, specifically RTUs and HPs. It executes optimization algorithms and communicates with the grid for demand response and energy savings.

## Key Features

1. **Energy Efficiency**: Advanced algorithms to minimize energy consumption of RTUs and HPs while maintaining indoor comfort. Includes automated diagnostics and scheduling for optimal performance.
2. **Demand Response**: Integration with utility signals to provide grid services, allowing buildings to adjust energy usage based on grid conditions and financial incentives.
3. **User-Friendly Web Interface**: Simplified setup and management, making energy control accessible for facilities with limited technical expertise.
4. **Scalable Control**: Capable of scaling from single-building deployments to multiple locations, adapting easily to varying HVAC configurations.

## Architecture

The architecture of AEMS integrates the following elements:

- **Web Interface**: Built using modern web technologies, it provides real-time feedback and energy management capabilities.
- **Edge Control Stack**: Deployed on-site, the stack interfaces with HVAC equipment using VOLTTRON agents to execute energy optimization and respond to external commands.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- A VOLTTRON installation is required for the edge stack. Refer to [VOLTTRON setup documentation](https://volttron.readthedocs.io/en/main/) for detailed guidance.
- The easiest way to deploy the AEMS web application is using Docker and Docker Compose.

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VOLTTRON/volttron-pnnl-aems.git
2. Refer to README in aems-app and aems-edge directories for installation.

## Usage

- Use the web UI to configure RTUs and HPs set points, set schedules, enable set backs and lock outs.
- Deploy edge agents to communicate with HVAC systems and execute control strategies.
- Enable grid-interaction features for demand response and participate in utility programs.
