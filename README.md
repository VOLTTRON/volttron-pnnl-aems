# Volttron PNNL AEMS

This repository contains two projects: `aems-edge` and `aems-ui`.
## Autonomous Energy Management Software (AEMS)

The AEMS adds intelligent and flexible control for small and medium
sized commercial buildings' HVAC systems. The AEMS enables energy efficiency measures
for thermostatically controlled packaged air conditioners and heat pumps. The
AEMS contains a web based user interface (aems-ui) to allow a building operator or occupants
to easily enable energy efficiency and comfort for their building. The second component is the
aems-edge. The edge software is integrated with the VOLTTRON project and utilizes the BACnet driver
for device integration, the VOLTTRON Historian for data storage, and the VOLTTRON integrated
Weather.gov for forecast information.
