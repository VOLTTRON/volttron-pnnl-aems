        <p>Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) and its research partner, Global Medical REIT, have developed an efficiency and grid services solution for a key, underserved segment of the nation's commercial buildings sector: small- and medium-sized buildings (SMBs). The solution—a low-cost central control system for structures without building automation systems—will more effectively manage heating and cooling, hot water, connected lighting, and potentially other building functions. It will be interoperable, user-centric, and retrofittable.</p>

        <p>Researchers estimate that not only will SMB owners and managers save money and equipment life, but broad deployment of the tool could potentially deliver significant energy and cost savings. The system also could help the grid mitigate heavy electricity demand, which provides flexibility that enables increased integration of clean energy. Autonomous Energy Management Software System has been deployed on your building and is managing the thermostats. To get more information on how to use the system, please refer to the "Info" page on the left.</p>
