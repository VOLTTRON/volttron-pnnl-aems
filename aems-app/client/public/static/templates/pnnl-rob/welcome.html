        <p>Welcome to the Advanced Energy Management System (AEMS) deployed at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory's Research Operations Building (ROB). This system represents a comprehensive building automation and energy management platform designed to optimize energy usage, reduce costs, and support grid flexibility while maintaining occupant comfort.</p>

        <h3>About AEMS</h3>
        
        <p>AEMS is a low-cost central control system developed by PNNL for buildings without existing building automation systems. The solution provides interoperable, user-centric, and retrofittable control for heating and cooling, hot water, connected lighting, and other building functions. This deployment at ROB serves as both a production system and a research testbed for advancing building energy management technologies.</p>

        <h3>System Capabilities</h3>

        <p>The AEMS platform at ROB provides comprehensive building automation capabilities:</p>

        <p><strong>HVAC Control & Optimization:</strong> Automated temperature and ventilation management with intelligent scheduling based on occupancy patterns, weather forecasts, and energy pricing. The system continuously monitors and adjusts setpoints to maintain comfort while minimizing energy consumption.</p>

        <p><strong>Energy Monitoring & Analytics:</strong> Real-time tracking of power consumption across all managed systems with detailed analytics dashboards. Historical data analysis provides insights into energy usage patterns, trends, and opportunities for optimization.</p>

        <p><strong>Demand Response & Grid Services:</strong> Dynamic load management and peak shaving capabilities that respond to grid signals and time-of-use pricing. The system can automatically adjust building loads to support grid stability and reduce demand charges.</p>

        <p><strong>Fault Detection & Diagnostics:</strong> Automated monitoring of system performance with intelligent alerts for anomalies, equipment malfunctions, and maintenance needs. Early detection helps prevent comfort issues and costly equipment failures.</p>

        <p><strong>Occupancy-Based Control:</strong> Smart scheduling that adapts to actual building usage patterns, reducing energy waste during unoccupied periods while ensuring comfort when spaces are in use.</p>

        <h3>Research & Development</h3>

        <p>As a PNNL facility, this deployment serves dual purposes. Beyond providing operational building management, it functions as a living laboratory for testing and validating new energy management algorithms, control strategies, and integration approaches. Insights gained from this deployment inform our research and help develop solutions that can be deployed across the nation's building stock.</p>

        <h3>Using the System</h3>

        <p>Navigate through the AEMS interface to access various features:</p>

        <p><strong>Dashboard:</strong> View real-time system status, current conditions, and key performance indicators for the building.</p>

        <p><strong>Schedules:</strong> Review and modify occupancy schedules and automated control sequences for different zones and systems.</p>

        <p><strong>Setpoints:</strong> Adjust temperature setpoints and other control parameters within approved ranges.</p>

        <p><strong>Analytics:</strong> Access detailed reports on energy usage, system performance, and cost savings over time.</p>

        <p><strong>Configurations:</strong> Manage system settings, user preferences, and integration parameters (admin access required).</p>

        <h3>Energy & Cost Savings</h3>

        <p>AEMS deployments typically achieve 10-30% energy savings compared to baseline operations, with exact savings depending on the building type, existing systems, and operational patterns. The system also helps reduce peak demand charges through intelligent load management and can participate in demand response programs to generate additional revenue.</p>

        <h3>Support & Documentation</h3>
